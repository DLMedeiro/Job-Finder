## Learnings
###  Meta and Meta Open Graph (OG) Data
- Optimize posts by providing more control over how information travels from a third-party website to Facebook when a page is shared (or liked, etc.).
- OGP tags are crucial because they allow you to control how your content appears when itâ€™s shared on sites
- The open graph tags let you control the title, description, and image in the post

### Mockaroo and ElephantSQL

### Mobile first design
